# Call Recording with Neon Database Integration

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This document describes the complete call recording feature that has been implemented as per the PRD. The system now automatically records calls, saves them both locally and to the Neon database, and displays them on the employee dashboard.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Dual Storage System**
- **Firebase Storage**: Primary storage (existing functionality preserved)
- **Neon Database**: Backup storage with full metadata and audio bytes
- Both systems work in parallel - if one fails, the other continues

### 2. **Automatic Call Recording**
- Toggle-based recording control (existing toggle preserved)
- Automatic detection of incoming/outgoing calls
- Records audio during active calls
- Saves recording locally on device
- Uploads to both Firebase and Neon automatically

### 3. **Database Schema (Neon PostgreSQL)**

**Table: `call_records`**
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key to users)
- customer_number (VARCHAR(50), indexed)
- customer_name (VARCHAR(255), nullable)
- call_type (VARCHAR(20): 'incoming' or 'outgoing')
- status (VARCHAR(20): 'recording', 'completed', 'transcribing', 'analyzed', 'failed')
- started_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE)
- ended_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE, nullable)
- duration_sec (INTEGER, nullable)
- audio_file_size (INTEGER, nullable)
- audio_mime_type (VARCHAR(50), default 'audio/m4a')
- audio_bytes (BYTEA, nullable) - Stores the actual audio file
- firebase_call_id (VARCHAR(255), indexed, nullable)
- firebase_audio_url (TEXT, nullable)
- transcript_text (TEXT, nullable)
- ai_summary (TEXT, nullable)
- sentiment_score (FLOAT, nullable)
- notes (TEXT, nullable)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE)
```

### 4. **Backend API Endpoints**

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token.

#### **POST `/api/calls/upload`**
Upload a call recording with metadata and audio file.

**Request (multipart/form-data):**
```
user_id: string (required)
customer_number: string (required)
customer_name: string (optional)
call_type: string (required) - 'incoming' or 'outgoing'
started_at: string (required) - ISO 8601 format
ended_at: string (optional) - ISO 8601 format
duration_sec: integer (optional)
firebase_call_id: string (optional)
firebase_audio_url: string (optional)
audio_file: file (optional) - .m4a audio file
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "customerNumber": "+1234567890",
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "callType": "outgoing",
  "status": "completed",
  "startedAt": "2025-10-10T12:00:00Z",
  "endedAt": "2025-10-10T12:05:00Z",

  "audioFileSize": 1234567,
  "audioMimeType": "audio/m4a",
  "firebaseCallId": "firebase-uuid",
  "firebaseAudioUrl": "https://...",
  "hasAudio": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-10T12:05:01Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-10T12:05:01Z"
}
```

#### **GET `/api/calls`**
Get call records with optional filters.

**Query Parameters:**
- `customer_number` (optional): Filter by customer phone number
- `user_id` (optional): Filter by employee user ID
- `limit` (optional, default 50): Maximum number of records to return

**Response:** Array of CallRecordResponse objects

#### **GET `/api/calls/{call_id}`**
Get a specific call record by ID.

**Response:** Single CallRecordResponse object

#### **GET `/api/calls/{call_id}/audio`**
Stream the audio file for a call recording.

**Response:** Audio file stream (audio/m4a)

#### **DELETE `/api/calls/{call_id}`**
Delete a call record (admin only or own calls).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Call record deleted successfully"
}
```

### 5. **Flutter Integration**

#### **New Service: `NeonCallService`**
Location: `lib/services/neon_call_service.dart`

Handles all communication with the Neon database backend:
- Upload call recordings
- Retrieve call history by customer or user
- Stream audio from backend
- Automatic authentication using stored JWT token

#### **Updated Service: `CallService`**
Location: `lib/services/call_service.dart`

Enhanced to dual-save recordings:
1. Records audio during call
2. Uploads to Firebase Storage (existing)
3. **NEW**: Also uploads to Neon database
4. If Neon upload fails, logs warning but doesn't fail the operation

### 6. **Android Configuration**

#### **Permissions (AndroidManifest.xml)**
All required permissions are already in place:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

#### **Network Security**
- Cleartext traffic enabled for HTTP access to local backend
- Network security config allows: localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.17, 10.0.2.2

### 7. **How It Works**

#### **Recording Flow:**
1. User enables call recording toggle in settings
2. App monitors phone state for incoming/outgoing calls
3. When call becomes active:
   - Start recording audio to local file (.m4a)
   - Create call record in Firebase
4. When call ends:
   - Stop recording
   - Calculate duration
   - Upload audio to Firebase Storage
   - Update Firebase call record with download URL
   - **Upload to Neon database** (audio file + metadata)
   - Delete local temporary file
5. Call appears on employee dashboard

#### **Dashboard Display:**
- Employee can view all their calls
- Filter by customer phone number
- See call duration, type (incoming/outgoing), timestamp
- Play audio recordings
- View AI summaries (if available)

## üîß Testing Instructions

### 1. **Backend Testing**

Start the backend server:
```bash
cd server
.\start_server.bat
```

Verify endpoints are available:
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Check OpenAPI docs
http://localhost:8001/docs
```

### 2. **Mobile Testing**

#### **On Device:**
1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Ensure device is on same WiFi as your PC
3. Backend must be running at `http://192.168.1.17:8001`
4. Sign in to the app
5. Enable call recording toggle in settings
6. Make or receive a phone call
7. Call should be recorded automatically
8. After call ends, check dashboard for the call record

#### **Verify in Database:**
You can query the Neon database directly to verify recordings:
```sql
SELECT id, customer_number, call_type, duration_sec, audio_file_size, created_at
FROM call_records
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. **Web Testing**

The web version uses the same backend but Firebase for storage:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080
```

## üìä Database Connection

The backend connects to your Neon PostgreSQL database using the connection string from `.env`:

```
NEON_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_6JZlrqGP1OCx@ep-super-bird-advyb94d-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

The `call_records` table is automatically created on server startup.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

1. **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **User Isolation**: Employees can only access their own call records (unless admin)
3. **Audio Storage**: Audio files stored as BYTEA in Neon (encrypted at rest)
4. **Network Security**: HTTPS recommended for production (currently HTTP for local dev)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Android Call Recording Limitations:**
- Some Android versions (10+) restrict call recording
- Recording may capture only one side of the conversation
- Requires RECORD_AUDIO permission at runtime
- User must grant permission when prompted

### **Storage Considerations:**
- Audio files stored in database can be large (1-5 MB per call)
- Consider implementing cleanup policy for old recordings
- For production, consider moving audio to object storage (S3/GCS) and storing URLs only

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing features remain unchanged
- Firebase storage continues to work as before
- Neon integration is additive, not replacement
- If Neon upload fails, Firebase storage still succeeds

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Transcription Integration**: Use Whisper API to transcribe recordings
2. **AI Analysis**: Generate summaries and insights using Gemini
3. **Customer Enrichment**: Auto-populate customer names from contacts
4. **Search & Filter**: Add advanced search capabilities
5. **Export**: Allow exporting call records as CSV/PDF
6. **Notifications**: Alert managers of important calls
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize call metrics and trends
